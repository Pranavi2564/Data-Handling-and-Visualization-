# Data Handling and Visualization with Python
## Overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) designed for data handling and visualization tasks using Python. The notebooks are tailored for use with Google Colab, providing a cloud-based environment for running code and creating interactive visualizations.  It provides scripts and examples for extracting data from online databases, processing it, and creating visualizations such as graphs to gain insights. This setup is ideal for data analysis, reporting, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
## Features
- Data Extraction: Scripts for connecting to and querying various online databases.
- Data Processing: Tools and techniques for cleaning and transforming data.
- Visualization: Examples of creating various types of graphs and plots using Python libraries.
- Google Colab Integration: Use Google Colab for running scripts and interactive data analysis in the cloud.
